# Implementation of DNN from scratch using OOP and numpy

In this notebook, I implement DNN using numpy only and declare these layers in terms of classes, writing forward and backward functions inside these classes. This is much more compact than writing the forward and backward equations in separate functions and takes much less lines to write.

This method of coding is learned from "The Independent Code" Channel in youtube from their playlist of writing neural networks from scratch: https://www.youtube.com/@independentcode
